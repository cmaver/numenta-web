We participated in an AskScience AMA (Ask Me Anything), where we answered questions about our new framework for intelligence and cortical computation called "The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence", and the potential implications for the future of AI and machine learning. The AMA will remain open, so feel free to post a question, or read through our responses to the previous questions.
