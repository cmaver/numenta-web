We're having an HTM meet-up at Numenta HQ! Several HTM Forum members will be in attendance. Come meet the HTM Community, Numenta engineers, and co-founders Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky!

Matt will host and give an update on the HTM Community. Jeff will also say a few words (probably more than a few). We will probably stream the whole event on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/rhyolight_). Our office is not huge, so please don't RSVP unless you really intend on coming!

Pizza and drinks will be available for guests.

Maps, directions and parking information is on [our website](/contact/)
