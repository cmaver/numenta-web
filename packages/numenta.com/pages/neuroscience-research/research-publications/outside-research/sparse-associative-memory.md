description: "This paper presents a new model of an associative memory that overcomes the typical deficiencies of spurious memories and low efficiency. The authors refer to it as associative memory (SAM) because it is based on sparse projections from neural patterns to pattern-specific neurons. This paper was inspired by the paper, "Why neurons have thousands of synapses, a theory of sequence memory in neocortex."
