## Abstract:
This poster, which is based on a paper by the same name, proposes that sparsity should be a key design principle for robustness. Numenta VP Research Subutai Ahmad presented this poster and a presentation on the topic at an ICML 2019 workshop on Uncertainty & Robustness in Deep Learning.
